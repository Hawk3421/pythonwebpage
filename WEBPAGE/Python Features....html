<p style="font-size:45px;color:Lime ;"">Python Features...</p>
<b> <p> </p> </b></h1>
<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">1.Easy to code:
<p>
Python is high level programming language.
Python is very easy to learn language as compared to other language like c, c#, java script, java etc.
<br>It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basic in few hours or days.It is also developer-friendly language

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">2. Free and Open Source:-
<p>
Python is high level programming language.Python language is freely available at official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python kyeword.
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download Python</a>
Since, it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public.So you can download it as, use it as well as share it.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">3.Object-Oriented Language::-
<p>One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming.Python supports object oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation etc.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">4.GUI Programming Support::-
<p>
Graphical Users interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython or Tk in python.
<br>PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">5. High-Level Language:-
<p>
Python is a high-level language.When we write programs in python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">6..Extensible feature::-
<p>Python is a Extensible language.we can write our some python code into c or c++ language and also we can compile that code in c/c++ language.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">7. Python is Portable language:-
<p>Python language is also a portable language.for example, if we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platform such as Linux, Unix and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">8.  Python is Integrated language:
<p>Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python with other language like c, c++ etc.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">9.Interpreted Language:-
<p>Python is an Interpreted Language. because python code is executed line by line at a time. like other language c, c++, java etc there is no need to compile python code this makes it easier to debug our code.The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

<p style="font-size:25px;color:Lime  ;"">10. Large Standard Library
<p>Python has a large standard library which provides rich set of module and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing.There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers etc.
