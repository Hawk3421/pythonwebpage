{1}-The Python programming language is freely available and makes solving a computer problem almost as easy as writing out your thoughts about the solution. The code can be written once and run on almost any computer without needing to change the program. 

<b> <p> </p> </b></h1>

{2}-Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural oriented programming.
<b>  <p> </p> </b></h1>
{3}-In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamic typed language.
For example, x=10
<b>  <p> </p> </b></h1>
here x can be anything such as String, int etc

<b>  <p> </p> </b></h1>

{4}-Python is an interpreted language. This means that it is not converted to computer-readable code before the program is run but at runtime. In the past, this type of language was called a scripting language, intimating its use was for trivial tasks. However, programming languages such as Python have forced a change in that nomenclature. Increasingly, large applications are written almost exclusively in Python.
