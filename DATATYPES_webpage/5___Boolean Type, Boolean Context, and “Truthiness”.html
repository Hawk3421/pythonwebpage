<p style="font-size:35px;color:Wheat ;"">(5)Boolean Type, Boolean Context, and “Truthiness” :-</p>
<b> <p> </p> </b></h1>
Python 3 provides a Boolean data type. Objects of Boolean type may have one of two values, True or False:. 
<br>
<br>Python Example:-
<br><p style="color:red;"> >>>type(True)
<br>class 'bool'
<br> <p style="color:red;">>>>type(False)
<br>class 'bool'<br>
<p>
As you will see in upcoming tutorials, expressions in Python are often evaluated in Boolean context, meaning they are interpreted to represent truth or falsehood. A value that is true in Boolean context is sometimes said to be “truthy,” and one that is false in Boolean context is said to be “falsy.” (You may also see “falsy” spelled “falsey.”)<p>
<p>
The “truthiness” of an object of Boolean type is self-evident: Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false.
<p>
You will learn more about evaluation of objects in Boolean context when you encounter logical operators in the upcoming tutorial on operators and expressions in Python.
